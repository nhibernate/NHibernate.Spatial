## Running the Tests

In order to run the tests, a MS SQL Server 2008 instance must be available for connection and correctly configured.

### Installation

MS SQL Server 2008 Express with Tools is free and can be downloaded from the [MS website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30438) (download and install the `SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe` package).

### Configuration

Once MS SQL Server 2008 has been set up, it must be initialized for testing:

1. Ensure that the "Server authentication" is set to "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" (see image below).

2. After changing the authentication mode, the server must be restarted for the changes to take effect (this can be done via the "SQL Server Configuration Manager").

3. Add a new `nhsp_test` user, using SQL Server authentication with `nhsp_test` for the password and making sure to untick "Enforce password policy" (see image below).

4. Create a new `nhsp_test` database, owned by the `nhsp_test` user (see image below).

5. Finally, the `Server=.` part of the connection string in the [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) file should be updated with the name of your server instance, e.g. `Server=hostname\MSSQLSERVER2008`.
